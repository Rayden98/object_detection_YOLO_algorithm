## About This Project

This repository contains an implementation of object detection using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm**. The project includes dataset handling, model preparation, and testing using a pre-trained YOLO model.

### Features:
- **Dataset Handling:** Downloads and processes data for training and evaluation.
- **Model Preparation:** Utilizes YOLO for object detection tasks.
- **Testing:** Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on real-world images.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the [COCO 2017 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset), which contains labeled images for training and testing.
